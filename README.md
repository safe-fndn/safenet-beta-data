# safenet-data

Data and JSON files for Safenet Beta, Safenet Aegis, and potentially future Safenet versions. Contains network stats, validator info, and rewards distribution data.

> **Auto-updates:** `assets/network-info.json` and the `participation_rate_14d` field in `assets/validator-info.json` are updated automatically every 3h. All other validator details are edited manually. Rewards data is updated manually, on a regular basis, if SafeDAO approves proposal for rewards distribution.

## Network Info

Aggregate network-level stats for Safenet Beta. See [`assets/network-info.json`](./assets/network-info.json) for current data.

### Example

```json
{
	"total_staked_amount": "123123.12331221",
	"total_transactions_checked": 88764457
}
```

#### `total_staked_amount`

Total SAFE tokens currently staked, as a decimal string with up to 18 decimal places (a string so precision is preserved). Sourced from the staking contract at [`0x115E78f160e1E3eF163B05C84562Fa16fA338509`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x115E78f160e1E3eF163B05C84562Fa16fA338509#code) on Ethereum mainnet.

#### `total_transactions_checked`

A monotonically increasing integer counting all `TransactionProposed` events on the consensus contract of a Safenet version since its deployment. Counts are per version and not aggregated across versions. For Safenet Beta, this is [`0x223624cBF099e5a8f8cD5aF22aFa424a1d1acEE9`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x223624cBF099e5a8f8cD5aF22aFa424a1d1acEE9) on Gnosis Chain.
